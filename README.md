"# QRG"

This program converts any piece of text into a QR code.

It is actually only available for Windows.

It is specially useful to reference long URLs. Just convert your long URL into a QR code image and send it to your friends, their smartphones will read the QR code and direct them exactly where you want.

I am not responsible of any missuse others might apply to my simple program. Nonetheless, I strongly discourage anybody who wishes to use my program for immoral purposes.
